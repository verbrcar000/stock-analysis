#Stock Analysis

##Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve's parents decide which stocks would be best for them to invest in. It calculates the total daily
volume for each stock as well as the return, first, making it clear which stocks did well and which did not. It also makes it easy to look at both
of these variables for the year 2017 or for the year 2018.
